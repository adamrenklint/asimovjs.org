title: Commands

text:

At the heart of asimov.js we have <code>ajs</code>, a command line interface that allows you to create projects, manage pages, run tests and much more, from your terminal.

Following the base principle of asimov.js, all default commands are built as plugins, and developers can easily add custom commands, or even overload existing ones.
