title: Visible, Hidden and Ignored Pages
---
text:

Folder names comes in three flavours:

```
/01-blog
  /01-hello-world
  /02-another-post
  /_draft
/contact
```

Folders with numbers define **visible** pages, folders without numbers are **hidden** pages and if it's prefixed with an underscore, it's considered an **ignored** page.

## Visible Pages

Visible in menus and page collections
Number is used for ordering
Number is stripped from url

## Hidden Pages

Not visible in menus
Only visible in page collections is explicitly set to show hidden
Can still link to them, public urls

## Ignored Pages

Ignored when crawling filesystem, not rendered
Secure way of saving drafts
