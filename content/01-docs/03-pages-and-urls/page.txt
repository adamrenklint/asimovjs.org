text:

Pages are simple textfiles, saved in the <code>/content</code> folder. Their urls are defined by the folder structure, and the name of the textfile defines what template is used to render it.

## Format of a page textfile

A page textfile consists of **content sections**, divided by three dashes, defining a key and some sort of value.

```
title: My awesome page!
%divider%
tags: epic, legendary
%divider%
text: Hello world!
```

### Plain text

The *title* section above is an example of a plain text content section, which will be available as a string in templates.

### List (array of strings)

The *tag* section will be parsed as an array of strings.

### Markdown

Pretty obvious, this one. [The one and only Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

### Handlebars

Using Handlebar′s syntax, you can include another value from the page textfile.

```
title: Important title
%divider%
text: I repeat, it is a very %cl%title%cr%
```

### YAML

Use nested data structures to avoid repetition.

```
title: A page of links
%divider%
links:
  adamrenklint:
    type: developer
    url: http://adamrenklint.com
%divider%
text: Visit the %cl%link links.adamrenklint.url links.adamrenklint.type%cr%
```

### HTML

Yeah, you read it. Good ol' HTML also works in page textfiles, to allow for truely flexible, page specific designs and layouts.
